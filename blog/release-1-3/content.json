{"body":"\n## Initiative Bonuses\n\nThe `live-game` encounter tracker now tracks the initiative bonus for each\ncombatant! This value is represented by the ðŸŒ€ emoji, and defaults to 0.\n\nYou can input a new value by navigating to the combatant of your choice and\ntapping the `b` key, then inputting a positive or negative value: e.g. `2` or\n`-1`.\n\n## Auto Initiative\n\nI've always felt that combat in D&D, while potentially very fun and rewarding,\ncan be a bit of a slog from a managerial perspective. Particularly when\nplaying in an online setting without the use of a Virtual Tabletop Environment,\ncontinuously asking players for initiative rolls for each encounter can\neat up a non-trivial amount of time. \n\nIn the past, I've tried various strategies for ameliorating this, such as\nsetting initiative in the order that the players actually react, or by doing\naway with it completely; however, both these methods tend to naturally favor\nmore assertive personalities, and since I like to see all types of people\nhave fun in my games, this was not satisfactory for me.\n\nSo, I've had the idea to add a feature to `live-game` for auto-rolling and\nauto-sorting character initiative. Now that the app tracks initiative bonuses,\nthe auto-initiative feature should retain any advantages held by characters\nto initiative, while at the same time streamlining the initiative process.\n\nUse of this feature will likely require buy-in from the players in your game,\ndepending on your DMing style, as setting initiative for the players does\ndeprive them of a die roll, and I'm willing to bet that many of us collect\ngreat satisfaction from the act of rolling dice. However, the goal is that the\ntime and effort saved via auto-initiative can get the players on to rolling\nthe dice that matter, such as attack and damage rolls, more quickly.\n\nI see this as a win.\n\nHappy dungeoneering.\n","staticData":{}}
